# Our Creative Process

*January 10, 2025 - by Alek Miller*

One question we get asked frequently is: "How do you two actually work together on creative projects?" It's a great question, and the answer has evolved over time as we've learned what works for our partnership.

## Division of Strengths

We've naturally fallen into roles that play to our individual strengths:

**Alek focuses on:**
- Game mechanics and systems design
- Story structure and narrative
- Technical implementation
- Project management and timelines

**Juleah focuses on:**
- Visual design and illustration
- Character development
- Art direction and aesthetic choices
- User experience and visual flow

## Our Collaboration Methods

### 1. The Evening Planning Session
Most of our creative planning happens after the kids are in bed. We'll sit down with coffee (or tea) and talk through ideas, review progress, and plan next steps.

### 2. Parallel Work Time
We often work on different aspects of the same project simultaneously. I might be coding a game mechanic while Juleah is designing the visual assets for it.

### 3. Regular Check-ins
We've learned the importance of frequent small check-ins rather than waiting for big reveals. This prevents us from going too far down incompatible paths.

### 4. Honest Feedback
We've developed the ability to give each other direct, constructive feedback without taking it personally. This took practice!

## Tools We Use

- **Shared Google Drive** for all project files
- **Figma** for design collaboration
- **Discord** for quick messages during the day
- **Physical notebooks** for brainstorming (yes, still!)

## Challenges We've Overcome

**Different working speeds:** I tend to rush toward completion while Juleah prefers to iterate and perfect. We've learned to respect both approaches.

**Communication gaps:** Early on, we'd assume the other person understood our vision. Now we over-communicate rather than under-communicate.

**Time management:** Balancing creative work with family time is ongoing. We're still figuring this out!

## What's Working Now

Our current approach centers around small, frequent collaboration rather than big dramatic creative sessions. We've found that 30 minutes of focused work together is often more productive than 3 hours of unfocused time.

We're also learning to celebrate small wins rather than waiting for major milestones. Finished a character design? That's worth acknowledging. Solved a tricky game mechanic? Time for a mini celebration.
