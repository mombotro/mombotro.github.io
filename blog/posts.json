    "text": "#webpub\n\nEarly\n\nI'm really, REALLY bad about getting up early in the morning. At heart, I am a morning person, but I consciously prefer acting like a night owl.\n\"Early\" applies to much more beyond the time we get up. This year, our household has the opportunity to file our taxes ridiculously early. Most years haven't been this easy; there were pre-tax investments, after-tax investments, small business incomes, small business expenditures, investment withdrawals, and occupation changing. Not this year. This year, it's just my income. Should be simple.\nTo be able to resolve our tax return before February would actually be faster than I've ever heard out of anyone. Would be a huge load of worry off our mind. Politics of the federal income tax aside, it'd be nice to just not have to think about it till next year.\nStarting this early means preparing for potential complications. Does the IRS take issue with our tax return? We have time to resolve that. Miss a source of income we previously thought invalid? We can incorporate that before April 15th. Good ol' fashioned issues with the US Postal Service? We can wait.\nEvery year we wait until early April, it's just worse. Better to just get it out of the way.\nThis applies most other places in life. Investing from an earlier age invariably leads to bigger returns. Physical exercise done earlier always leads to an easier time getting back into shape later on. Doing something right the first time is better than attempting to do it over.\nI can hear exceptions brewing in some of your heads. Of course there are exceptional circumstances. I'm not dealing with them.\nMake a point to do work, hard work, the annoying work, first. Get that out of your day's way. You will thank yourself later.",

    "text": "*The Cheese*\n\nOctober 9, 2025\nby Juleah Miller\n#webpub\n\nThe boy trailed several feet behind his mother, stepping carefully over the cracks and only in the pale blue, dingy vinyl tiles. He found himself here among the towering, poorly organized shelves quite reluctantly, it being too hot in the middle of summer to hang out in the car. He could feel his mother's tension at the thought of having to police a toddler and hastily shop for groceries on a limited time budget. This divided attention lent well to his curious little hands and the myriad of brightly colored packages; the boxes recieving a light rebuke from mother, and glass jars invoking the full wrath of God. The scathing corrections slid right over the toddler's immature brain like water off a ducks back.\n\nLow rumbles, quiet chatter, intermittent beeps, and an inoffensive jingle mixed into a slurry of sounds assaulting and drowning the senses of the boy. The low cacophany ceased in a moment and the lights dimmed, casting the boy into deep shadow. For a moment, he paused, searching for the cause of the sudden absence of all senses. The boy's mother continued her harried shopping, her muttering and shuffling a dull note amongst the nothing.\n\nThe boy slowly became aware of the glow beyond his mother. The light grew in intensity until his mother was a mere silhouette, her shadow shrinking in the blinding light. The boy's feet stumbled forward, drawn hypnotically by the light. Eyes never leaving, he stepped around his mother. The light hit his eyes with full intensity. Instictively, his hands flew up to cover his face. Eyes watering, the glow abated as his eyes adjusted to the light. A cold blast of air chilled his cheeks. Upon the shelves, mist swirling, sat a glorious block of cheese. It was pure gold, and the smell... the smell. The boy had never smelled anything more delicious. Before he properly registered it, the cheese rested reverently in his hands. Arms cradling it as if it were a newborn fawn. The cheese was simultaneously cool and vibrantly warm.\n\nClaws sharply clutched his shoulder and the illusion broke. The rumble, beeps, chatter, and lights flooded back to his senses; the cheese ripped from his hands as quickly as his fingers found it. The scold was harsh.The words washed over his body as he watched the cheese blasphemed, merely tossed irreverantly back onto the shelf. Tears stung the boys eyes, not at the verbal barbs from his mother, but for the callous disregard for his perfect cheese.\n\nThe tongue lashing and finger wagging finished quickly, the mother remembering how little time she truly had for this excursion. The boy stood still, shocked and rooted to the spot. His mother turned away with an impatient beckoning of her hand. Head frozen, the boy's eyes slid until his gaze fell upon the cheese once more. The radiant warmth of its embrace welcomed him. His eyes slid to his mother now several feet away and counting. The timing would soon close before she turned and griped at him again.\n\nThe boy's brain didn't process the movement, but he found himself walking dutifully behind his mother, cheese in hand. The boxes and jars no longer called to him, their color dulled and ugly before the brilliant glow of the golden cheese. He gave no cause for his mother to look down. Her mood considerably brightened and the shopping experienced streamlined, the hedge maze of shelves blurring together. Nothing else was real. He had his cheese.\n\nBeep, beep, beep. The hand of the cashier deftly scanned another item from the pile of boxes and bags bumping along the wet conveyor belt. The boy's mother breathed a sigh of relief. The boy clutched the cheese, leaning as if glued to his mother's leg. Money exchanged hands. The bags crinkled in his mother's grip. She stepped away from the register and sighed with a smile. Her eyes took one last look around the area, searching for anything amiss. Her eyes fell on the boy.",

    "text": "Darkness plunged around the boy once more. His cheese glowed dimmly in his arms, barely illuminating his mother standing just beyond the golden halo. A sharp whistling from afar rushed in and penetrated his ears. The boy's mothering leaned into his circle of light, her face lit from below, holding a peculiar blank expression that he had never seen before. His mother snaked her arm slowly around his middle. The boy froze. The whistling reached an earshattering pitch. Sound, darkness, and his world imploded at same time she constricted his waist.\n\nThe boy lifted high into the air, his cheese ripped from his hands by claws like razorblades. The beep, beep, beep carried on.",
