    "text": "\"BAFTA 2026 - words only\"\n\nMan in the audience of the British version of movie awards has a heated gamer moment, dropping a nuclear during a presentation by Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo. (is this obscure enough? i sure hope not) People were definitely upset at the outrageous interruption.\nNot people on the internet, just the people who report tabloid news.\nIt was quickly discovered that the outbursting individual suffers from Tourette's syndrome. The man claims he couldn't stop himself, he couldn't help it, and it was completely involuntary. By and large, the reaction from common commenters is \"Very unfortunate, very understandable.\" This reaction I find quite welcome, actually. Instead of immediately concluding that this was an unapologetic racist epithet, people took a moment to survey the circumstances before judging. Perhaps the incredulity of the event was enough to make everyone pump the brakes. Great, hope we can apply that elsewhere too, please.\nFor the record, no, I don't condone using the word. It was wrong to say here. Period. I just want to get that out there and out of the way.\nJordan and Lindo didn't engage the outburst, just kept trucking with their planned speech. Bless 'em. The best thing to happen about this is that hopefully a few more people check out SINNERS, great movie, enjoyed it.\nLemme give an example of this event from a different perspective, for those of you unable to sympathize for the outburster: Suppose you are pulled over by a cop. You don't know why. You've done nothing wrong, to your knowledge. There's no illegal items in your car. Your insurance and registration are up to date. You're pretty sure your lights are all working. You even feel confident you didn't speed. All of those reasonable conclusions don't matter because you're sweating your butt off and your nerves are a wreck. The officer approaches, notices you're a nervous wreck, and do you think that makes him or her feel BETTER? No, it heightens their awareness too. Now you've got two parties that are nervous, at least one of which is armed with deadly force, and neither is certain they can safely deescalate.\nLook, there's no reason to freak out, to feel fear, to act all defensive, etc. But the mind doesn't respond all that rationally. Panic is deadly because it spreads, first in you, then in others.  You're not trying to make the cop nervous in this hypothetical situation, but your attempts to reduce your nerves only amplify them, and that in turn amplifies the cop's nerves. Unjustified or not, your response and the reasons for it have contributed to the problem.\nSo I understand why this moment got past the filters in the man's mind and left his mouth audbily for all to hear. His mind brought it up as a suggestion (brains are dumb), his mental filters said \"No,\" his mind pressed on anyways, his nerves got tested and failed, and the suggestion only gained power. I find it perfectly reasonable to conclude that the man backed himself into the corner. An apology is necessary, but not the kind about being the racist that he isn't.\nThe real scandal here is it didn't get edited out. The scene was prerecorded. It could have been edited out. Some people may have noticed the difference (and now I must newly wonder if this has been done before) and gone searching for wild geese, but that's a really small price to pay for not editing out the word that spells literal doom for white people who say it.\nUnconfirmed to me was the \"free Palestine\" messaging getting edited out. If true, then these awards care more about public image than films. Incredibly ironic if that's the case.\nAnways, don't say the word. Go watch SINNERS instead.",

    "text": "\"Music\"\n\nYears ago, my dad relented that the best classical music coming out these days came from soundtracks. This wasn't easy for him to do, I don't think. I grew up on his albums of Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Rossini, Tchaikovsky, and Dvorak. We both love and appreciate classical music, and we both agree that around the turn of the 20th century, classical music fell off a cliff.\n\nI came to this conclusion about soundtracks first. I play more games and... maybe watch more movies and TV. Not so sure anymore. (it's his turn to catch up now that he's retired and I've got the little ones to raise) I'll be posting soundtracks that evoke similar beauty, competence, and reverence that classical music imbues. \n\nActually, it was around 7th grade that I came to this conclusion, now that I'm thinking about it. My band teacher laughed at the notion that video game music could be counted as \"real music.\" I'll say this: more people have heard Skyrim than played Skyrim. And the playerbase for that game is already in the millions. A coworker had Spotify play random music and immediately recognized \"Secunda.\" He didn't know it was from a game. Didn't need to know it was from a game.\n\nIt's just dang good music.\n\nAnyhow, here's Farthest Frontier's soundtrack:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkIMeAiYKE4&list=PLzkMK0tRV0VZzkytFNQPbV9pID9-FqhTK\n  \n  YouTube\n  \n  Farthest Frontier OST - 01 Main Theme\n  Farthest Frontier Original Soundtrack - 01 Main Theme\n\nAvailable on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1044720/Farthest_Frontier/\n\nhttps://www.farthestfrontier.com/\n\nComposed by: Steve Pardo and SkewSound\n\n\n  \n  \n    1 viewAlek Miller, 03:20",

    "text": "\"That's Great, But...\"\n\nThis thought has been gaining traction in my head. It only just dawned on me what it should be called, what it looks like, and why it's important. When arguing with someone who you think is on a bad path but doing quite well for themselves, the most wildly ineffective argument you could make is \"Man, that's great, that's fine and all, I'm really happy for you, but actually...\"\nThe first part of this statement admits there is no reason for the person to leave where they're at. There's no push out of their current position. He can just stand there, and you've just agreed that that's acceptable.\nThe second part completely undermines the first. \"But...\" undoes any winning you may have done during the discussion. It implies there is a pull motivation that will surely yank the other into your desired zone. But if there's no reason to move, then there's no reason to move.\nChristians will swap factions because of the push of being in disobedience to God, and the pull of closer and more complete truth of God. So if I, as a Protestant, don't feel I am in disobedience to God, that I am already saved by grace through faith, and believe I have the complete truth of God (in this case, Jesus's Gospel message), then I have neither push out of Protestantism nor pull towards Catholicism or Orthodoxy.\nMost Catholics and Orthodox are very pastoral in this matter. They wouldn't dare answer for God whether I'm truly saved or not. They fall into this ineffectual argument of \"Well that's great, but you're not part of the One True Holy Church, and that's a problem, so why don't you see that and fix it?\" I admire the gentility. It's obviously very effective with a lot of people. For me, however, it feels like gently hug-boxing me in to the group of their own choosing. People like me are sensitive to that and reject it categorically.\nThere are some Catholics, Orthodox, Reformed, and other Protestants who will unequivocally state something quite reasonably conclusive like \"extra ecclesiam nulla salus.\" I don't like these people with their often prideful attitude, but I absolutely respect them for their tenacity to their beliefs. They have the brutal honesty to admit that what I believe is \"Not great.\" There is no \"But...\" on the other side.\nWhen I find someone who is on fire for his or her particular faction, I test them by leaning in to the accusation. \"That's why us Protestants aren't saved. Aren't true Christians.\" The first type will say \"Well no, actually,...\" and do their best to make up. The second type will say \"Well, yeah, actually.\" The first type want to gently corral you into their space. The second type have the guts to say you're out-of-bounds, so YOU move.\nThis applies much more importantly to non-believers. Atheists who have grown comfortable in the modern era with current-age niceties (A/C, plumbing, medicine, reliable transportation, speedy communication, nutritional availability, dietary variety) is someone who isn't worried about hell after death. He's content to eat, drink, and be merry in the here and now. Tomorrow be darned. He can party till 2 AM with fancy vodka, gourmet morsels, and dance with sophisticated and stimulating individuals.",

    "text": "We've all seen conversion stories of people who turned to Christ after all that obvious Eccelsiastical meaninglessness. But we have yet to see the people who stay there. The folks who are content in that space have no push away and no pull to yoink them out. When they ask us why they should join our faction, the reasons we give them and the reasons for those reasons will inevitably fall flat. They see our faith as a peculiarity and nothing more. \"Oh isn't that very interesting. ...Thank you, I'll take another, make it a double, please.\" Everyone acts generally nice towards each other, a certain baseline of etiquette is observed and silently enforced. The mysteries of the known universe are being solved day by day, and the secrets humanity has yet to uncover shall be soon enough. He can live his life in enjoyable peace and that's all he desires. He is content without anything more.\nScaring him out of this state by pointing to the Bible which he doesn't believe in isn't going to work. This doesn't disprove the Bible, no. I'm saying that he's already evaluated it and found it completely unnecessary. He denies the Bible regardless of how we defend it. But he wants you to defend it. He knows you can't. Again, this doesn't disprove the Bible; all it does is show that you can't change his mind no matter how hard you try. He doesn't need convincing and he's not asking for it. He's toying with a monkey who's locked himself in a cage.\nSo at the very least, don't give him that satisfaction.\nWhat worked for me (and I don't know how effective this will be for other materialists) is to try experiencing no life after death, true ego destruction. That is the logical conclusion of atheistic materialism. No one is going to put me back in that spot, ever. I am forever out of the atheist and materialist spaces because I would rather believe it is not true even if it turns out true. \"You're emotionally immature\" is exatly correct and I accept it without argument.\nPerhaps more difficult is the pull in one direction or another. I find Christianity most satisfying. I have infinitely more respect for the LDS member who believes in Space Jesus in all but name, and for the devout and peaceful Muslim who just wants to obey the Creator of the universe; than I do for the athiest materialist who's happily content with the paltry rewards of this world.\nI do not consider Catholics, Orthodox, Reformed, Lutheran, or any of the major Christian factions non-Christian or heretical. I think they are wrong on things; I do not think they are stupid or somehow unbelieving. Fighting between factions is small fry; wrestling with the complacency of atheism is much more imperative. They are not fine. They are not in a \"great\" position. But it will take any of our disparate factions to draw them out of their unbelief.\nYou Christians are all my brothers and sisters in Christ. You are fine. You are in GREAT positions. I have zero doubt in my mind. I treat you this way as I wish to be treated this way. Please, let's focus on the truly unsaved.",

    "text": "Hospital Bills\n\nCouple months ago, I had to take a kid to the emergency room. Doctor's orders. I dreaded the idea of several hours of waiting just to see a doc who didn't care and a bill that cost too much. Well, the waiting part was true. The doctor and staff were great, and MediShare did some voodoo magic to slice our bill by 70%. \"Can't explain that,\" as Bill O'Reilly put it.\nI have mixed feelings about healthcare. This is specialized work, with high demand, at 24/7 availability (for ER, anyway). Doesn't feel right to be too peeved about a bill in the thousands of dollars. Of course I want to pay less. But I also don't always have the right time to visit cheaper doctors.\nI have no second thoughts regarding health insurance. MediShare has been a boon throughout this. Grateful to be part of the program.\nThe last time I was in an ER was age 6. Went down a hill way too fast on my Little Tykes trike. Still got the scar that the stitches left in me. Since then, been to Urgent Care a few times, sort of a barebones ER that's still available 24/7. \"Now, with your insurance (it was really freakin' good insurance), this visit is going to cost you $50. Is that alright?\" What do you mean \"is that alright.\" Absolutely fine by me, I'll pay it now, take my money, y'all saved me half a day of PTO.\nA lot of health stuff I've been able to avoid by just living healthily. Some stuff, I got lucky. Other stuff, you just can't avoid. This ER trip with my son was one of those.\nWe finally got accepted into the back. IV drip (that was no fun, boy's arms are thin as twigs), X-ray, other vitals, plenty of questions. Doctor eventually visits and explains that a CT isn't necessary given my son's age and what we're dealing with. Diagnosis? Constipation. Run to Wal-Mart (which is closed at 2:30 AM when we left) and spend $15 on Miralax.\nSo we didn't spend all that time and money for a treatment only the hospital could administer. No, we spent that time and money to ensure it WASN'T something only the hospital could take care of. Wasn't appendicitis or something similiarly scary. That peace of mind has its own value. This encounter went really, really well. I'm grateful for that.\nNext time, we'll try Miralax first.",

    "text": "Visual vs Literary\n\nEveryone has a \"first time\" with Lord of the Rings. Mine was via Peter Jackson's movie trilogy. Like everyone else, I watched and loved it. I picked up The Silmarillion because the title sounded cool and figured how different could it be? Age: 15. Big mistake. Please do not do that. I had a really bad time with it, could not get past Tolkien's writing style, nor could I for the life of me keep track of the many diferent characters. I read slowly as-is, but to my credit, I brute forced my way through it within... a year, I think.\n18 years later, I finally decide to listen to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic via audiobook. I set the speed to 2x (it is rare for me to set it below 1.3x). I would never have completed it if I were stuck at 1x, not due to time constraints but because I would have dropped it. Sorry, guys. Still nothin' doin'.\nOne distinct advantage to the audiobook narration over just reading it is the narrator actually sang the songs. That proved to be an unexpected boon.\nIs my problem the fact I saw a visual version before reading the literary source? Honestly, I really don't think so. Tolkien's writing style is still is a complete whiff for me. I'm not going to say he was a bad writer, all I'm saying is his pulp will never be something my brain can digest.\nTom Clancy, oddly, is pulp my brain CAN digest. I will never recommend a Clancy novel to anyone just out of the blue. His books are long, preachy, and long. You have to show an interest and ask me for a recommendation before I suggest \"Without Remorse\" to you.\n\"Hunt for Red October\" was a movie I watched well before I listened to the novel. I had already listened to the rest of the books in the series by the time I got to the narration of this first entry. Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin, Tim Curry, James Earl Jones, and the rest of the cast nailed it. There's an abridged narration of the audiobook I realy liked, too; basically follows the formula of the film. I expected the full, unabridged audiobook to be tight, compact, straightforward, enjoyable, and filled with amateurish charm.\nIt's actually my least favoirte book in the series. (\"The Bear and the Dragon\" slides in at second worst) The problem is it's NOT tight, compact, straightforward, or enjoyable. It's filled with amateurish over-attention to too many details, droning on and on about technical stuff in a way that is boring here that he somehow corrects by the time Clancy gets to the next Jack Ryan entry, \"Patriot Games.\"\nIn any event, for Clancy and \"Hunt for Red October,\" the abridged book and the film adaptation are on the same level. Visual and literary are equal here. The full book doesn't come close to either of those for the objective reasons I mentioned.\nNow for an example of a modern adaptation (albeit still literary) that vastly improves upon the source: William Hope Hodgson's \"The Night Land.\" Wife read this in the original \"Greek,\" so to speak and will never do that again. Hodgson's style is archaic, meandering, and overpunctuated (too many commas all over the place). James Stoddard retold the story and made it at least readable for modern audiences. I managed to get through it. I cannot even imagine attempting the source.\n\"3 Body Problem\" I unfortunately watched via Netflix before getting to Cixin Liu's novels. His fans swear by the books and take issue with Netflix disincluding a lot of the deeper scientific aspects. Look, my Bachelor's is of Science and I still struggled to keep up. I see why the version with Benedict Wong, Liam Cunningham, and co. is more digestable for a lot of people. (I can't say \"more\" people because China has a lot of those)",

    "text": "I guess my point in saying all this is that the literary isn't inherently better than the visual. The vice versa sounds absurd, but it doesn't go without saying: the visual isn't inherently better than the literary. \"The books/manga are better\" can't simply be presumed, there must be objective reasons why they're better. \"The movies/TV series are better\" is far less common, but no less presumptuous, and the criteria must be similarly objective.\nSay you just like the written word more, and prefer the mental images in your head over the concocted ones on-screen. That's fine. Perfectly valid. No argument from me. But to say that it's objectively better cannot be simply taken for granted. Lemme spitfire some examples to get you thinking:\nIs \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" better as a book or as the Disney film adaptation? What about the BBC version, hahahaha?\nIs \"The Expanse\" better as the 9-book series, or the 6-season show? (I really enjoyed both)\nIs \"Babette's Feast\" better as the feature-length foreign film, or the 45-page novella?\nIs \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" better as a manga, or either the first adaptation or the \"Brotherhood\" one?\nIs \"Star Wars\" better as a film saga, than it is in the dozens of novels?\nIs \"Harry Potter\" better on-screen, or in-page?\nLet's throw a different wrench into the mix: compare a written story to a comic adaptation. Which is better? What if the comic got turned into a novel? Would that be an improvement?\nI suppose there's a really useful (if very controversial) way to test thses comparisons. And I'll go back to LotR since that seems to be the big one. AI technology has and will continue to advance to the point that Tolkien's classic can be 1-to-1 adapted visually. You can keep Tom Bombadil. You can end with the scouring of the Shire. Would superfans like that more than Peter Jackson's more cinematically-contained version? Would superfans find it objectively better?",

    "text": "Anime, Abridging, and Faith\n\nCatholicism has the depth of an anime with too much lore. But first, a story.\n2011 was a more pivotal year than I remember it to be. Halfway through college, I watched all the anime I never had the chance to back in high school. I was a sucker for high-animation fight scenes like those in Ninja Scroll and Sword of the Stranger. Someone recommended Fate/Zero, read a glowing review of it, and sat down to watch it.\nIt drove the wind out of my sail. I started skipping sections and feeling no worse for wear. At the halfway point, I dropped it. Right then and there, I decided I wouldn't waste time on series and movies that didn't immediately hook me.\nSame became true of abridged series. Team Four Star's Dragon Ball Z Abridged reached episode 20 and I dropped it for much the same reason: the return diminshed while the time investment increased.\nA year later, I strove to create my own abridged series. Something I wanted to enjoy rewatching. A tribute to the fast, highly-comedic parodies that pulled me in originally. I'm pleased to say each of my episodes (including the finale) was under 10 minutes long; many clocked in under 5 minutes. I also finished the thing. That allowed me to move on to other projects. I had settled it in my mind. Abridging was a chapter in my life, one I frequently refer back to, but know in my heart that I have no more pages to write. That's a blessing, don't feel bad about it.\nMy wife commented early in our marriage that I had little patience for movies or TV shows. It amazed her I could just drop a piece of media so quickly and so early on. So this had become a practice of mine, and become outwardly observable. If I felt filler creep in, stealing my time away, I wasn't likely to continue it. I might have it on in the background on a second screen while I was busy doing something else (usually gaming in Warframe), but I wasn't really paying attention to it. Consider the episodes \"vain repitition,\" if you will.\nThat might as well bring me back to my thesis. Catholicism is like an anime with too much lore to carry. Where'd this come from? How does this possibly apply? Why do I hate Catholics?\nFirst, I love Catholics. The reverence for the spiritual and dedication to glorifying God through art and music are commendable. I see them as brothers and sisters in Christ.\nThis conclusion came from the couple of months I've observed comment debates between Catholics and non-Catholics. \"You don't have the fullness of the faith. You're missing out on the theological depth of the Catholic Church.\" It finally converged on me that this is the same argument anime and abridging fans will use to hawk their favorite series. \"You don't understand the fullness of DBZA because you haven't watched the source material.\" That's awfully close to a real reply I received. No, I'm not willing to subject myself to that many hours of a show I'm likely not going to like to challenege a conclusion I'm very unlikely to change. Think I'll take my chances on this one, thanks.\nFrieren skyrocketed in popularity around 2025. I caved and got one month of Netflix to see what it was all about. By this point, my wife was much on the same page as me with respect to pacing. She was bored after the pilot episode. \"Nothing happened. That could've been so much shorter.\"\nIt's true that the Catholic Church has a wealth of theological material to read, absorb, discuss, and wrestle with. But the conclusion I'm quickly reaching is that it's only really necessary for those who care deeply about it. Acts 16:30-31 says, \"Then he brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household.\"\" I see no \"But wait, there's more.\"\nThe foundational, baseline, starting point Gospel is that. So many of our personally-held convictions aren't traditions everyone else must be required to follow. Paul rebuked Peter for that in the church in Galatia.",

It distills its story so much, it crunches lore into lines of dialogue where they overlap with action on-screen. It's too fast for most people. I DO NOT RECOMMEND watching Ninja Scroll because every content warning under the sun applies to that film. All I'm saying is it's a masterclass in pacing, similar to how Jesus's Gospel is the distilled message of salvation for all people. There's no filler to it. It is sufficient all on its own. The fullness of the message is its single phrase. No need for a season 2 or episode 2,000.\nRacking up hours on you My Anime List profile is pointless. Writing out the 60th installment of your dumb anime parody is dumb. 2,000 years of church history can easily distract us from the one foundational truth that we always, always must come back to.\nJesus Christ is Lord.",

    "text": "A Day In Heaven\n#webpub \nHe awoke from his daylight slumber rested and restored. Getting up, he dressed himself for work. The woman he had spent life with met him outside their respective small apartments, heading out to the plot.\nTheir plot was cared for by an unnamed Cambodian martyr. Under his supervision, the two wished the martyr a good day, Bless the Name, and headed out to dig. In life, the man had been a successful doctor. His career had several key moments of righteousness, but no one seriously thought of him as a very good man. But he believed in the Son and had not wavered in that, at least. Both had enjoyed pleasurable lifestyles during life. The martyr, naturally, did not. And so now in Paradise on the New Earth, the couple were last and the martyr was first.\nThe man dug his row while humming a hymn. The words didn't come easily, so he focused on the tunes at least. The woman followed suit, placing seeds in each furrow the man created. In due time, bok choy would grow from this line. It always would succesfully, no doubt about that.\nLunchtime arrived. The two strolled over to pear trees planted from saplings 300 years before. It was their favorite. Plucking the brown-gold fruit, they relished the sweet, better-than-real taste. Each praised the Name, then returned to their work.\nLater that afternoon, Stephen the Martyr visited. He was greeted warmly by the farmers and then their supervisor. The Cambodian and Stephen talked the rest of the day, learning more of the other, praising the Name for the opportunity and ability He gave them.\nThe two made a modest dinner of Vietnamese pho with pork broth, enough for all of them. The martyrs thanked their cooks, said grace, then dug in. The man and the woman were so happy to simply perform basic tasks that, in life, they would never have dared to bother with.\nIt was just another day in heaven.",

Wouldn't that be better than letting the public go all Wild West on it and demand more, more, more? You want a government agency to step in and regulate what we can and can't see, what data we can and can't use, how much data we can and can't process: good freaking luck, my man. That'll piss off way more than the ever-edgy libertarians and anarcho-capitalist twin cousins.\nSo this development is likely inevitable. And I even see the potential for great good to come of it. Although I'm not planning on that one bit. There is one ray of sunshine to this, however: local communities are banding together on this issue. I may ultimately disagree with them on this issue (I'm too jaded to decide right now); I'm just really glad to see small towns light their beacons and rally their populaces, getting the word out and sounding alarm bells to at least pay attention.\nThe local level is the one I care most about. The rest of the country is \"not in my backyard.\"",

    "text": "Stories of data centers getting constructed in towns across the US have come out over the past year. One is finally slated for our area, a local friend tipped all of their friends and I happened to see the post. Didn't think I'd ever deal with this, then realized some alarming conclusions, so I'm diving deeper.\nJust YouTube alone has grown to the point where its digital data growth is over 4 petabytes per day. If you have a 1TB hard drive, get 4,000 more, and you have YouTube's daily growth. Actually a lot smaller than I imagined. Of course, that's just YouTube, one site out of billions. All the data generated in a day gets stored somewhere. That storage has to be present somewhere. Where is our Gmail account data stored? Somewhere, surely.\nI never heard debate of these data centers until the past 12 months. What's the difference? Seems to be AI (as it ever is and will be for the foreseeable future). Machine learning is something I heard about in the late 2010s to great hype. \"Big data\" was something to put on your resume. Just the initial applications for machine learning of \"big data\" showed promise, in my opinion. Lot of industries could use that kind of processing power. And think of the future: going to outer space, these applications and their complications will have to grow ...astronomically.\nRemember the crypto craze? Alarming reports went out about crypto mining operations, ostensibly placed in colder climate countries to reduce costs on keeping the electronics from overheating. Consuming vast amounts of electricity has been on the minds of environmentally-minded people for an entire century. The NIMBY-ism was there too, it's just scaled up.\n\"NIMBY\" stands for \"not in my backyard.\" Nobody wants a multi-acre, noisy, water-guzzling, energy-consuming, polluting data center across the street from them. Do I want that in my small town? No. Short and selfish answer is \"No.\" It's the natural human reaction.\nBut I can be sold on it. My price doesn't come cheap. I need to know exactly how this is going to be used. Who has access to it. What types of data are getting processed. What sort of environmental remediation treatments are promised. How those remediation treatments would be verified. Why all this? I can see industries and hospitals utilizing these data centers to boost production, cut costs, reduce wait times for patient care, increasing effectiveness, contributing to research.\nBunch of our metals come from the ground. IN the ground. That ground is rock and has to be processed if we're going to get the metals out of it. The ground isn't moving: we have to accept that. If you sit on a vein of gold or a trap of oil in your backyard, you'd think twice before rushing to refuse construction on your property. Point is you should think twice, regardless of which direction you initially want to rush off towards.\nRare Earth Elements (REEs) are a key export from overseas (China). The process for retrieving and refining them is inhumane, or exorbitant. Look up some photos of the villagers deformed by living near the operations. Oh we would never support that... Every lithium battery does. Every solar cell does. From electric vehicles to rooftop solar panels, our dollars contribute to that inhumane process.\nAI data centers could be used to invent new technologies, improve current ones, cut down on inefficiencies, free up labor for other tasks. If that's what happens, we could be looking at a huge increase in productivity, life longevity, medicine availability, industrial progress, and overall knowledge base.\nMy pessimism says otherwise. AI data centers will be used instead to flood social media with fake news, escape further from reality through games and virtual companions. That isn't the AI's fault, however. It's not the data center's fault either. That's our fault. Collectively, we're \"dun goofing\" right now. Smart phones carried this possibility too, the world's knowledge and a million useful applications in the palm of our hands. We don't use it for that and we know it.",

    "text": "#webpub\n\nEarly\n\nI'm really, REALLY bad about getting up early in the morning. At heart, I am a morning person, but I consciously prefer acting like a night owl.\n\"Early\" applies to much more beyond the time we get up. This year, our household has the opportunity to file our taxes ridiculously early. Most years haven't been this easy; there were pre-tax investments, after-tax investments, small business incomes, small business expenditures, investment withdrawals, and occupation changing. Not this year. This year, it's just my income. Should be simple.\nTo be able to resolve our tax return before February would actually be faster than I've ever heard out of anyone. Would be a huge load of worry off our mind. Politics of the federal income tax aside, it'd be nice to just not have to think about it till next year.\nStarting this early means preparing for potential complications. Does the IRS take issue with our tax return? We have time to resolve that. Miss a source of income we previously thought invalid? We can incorporate that before April 15th. Good ol' fashioned issues with the US Postal Service? We can wait.\nEvery year we wait until early April, it's just worse. Better to just get it out of the way.\nThis applies most other places in life. Investing from an earlier age invariably leads to bigger returns. Physical exercise done earlier always leads to an easier time getting back into shape later on. Doing something right the first time is better than attempting to do it over.\nI can hear exceptions brewing in some of your heads. Of course there are exceptional circumstances. I'm not dealing with them.\nMake a point to do work, hard work, the annoying work, first. Get that out of your day's way. You will thank yourself later.",

    "text": "*The Cheese*\n\nOctober 9, 2025\nby Juleah Miller\n#webpub\n\nThe boy trailed several feet behind his mother, stepping carefully over the cracks and only in the pale blue, dingy vinyl tiles. He found himself here among the towering, poorly organized shelves quite reluctantly, it being too hot in the middle of summer to hang out in the car. He could feel his mother's tension at the thought of having to police a toddler and hastily shop for groceries on a limited time budget. This divided attention lent well to his curious little hands and the myriad of brightly colored packages; the boxes recieving a light rebuke from mother, and glass jars invoking the full wrath of God. The scathing corrections slid right over the toddler's immature brain like water off a ducks back.\n\nLow rumbles, quiet chatter, intermittent beeps, and an inoffensive jingle mixed into a slurry of sounds assaulting and drowning the senses of the boy. The low cacophany ceased in a moment and the lights dimmed, casting the boy into deep shadow. For a moment, he paused, searching for the cause of the sudden absence of all senses. The boy's mother continued her harried shopping, her muttering and shuffling a dull note amongst the nothing.\n\nThe boy slowly became aware of the glow beyond his mother. The light grew in intensity until his mother was a mere silhouette, her shadow shrinking in the blinding light. The boy's feet stumbled forward, drawn hypnotically by the light. Eyes never leaving, he stepped around his mother. The light hit his eyes with full intensity. Instictively, his hands flew up to cover his face. Eyes watering, the glow abated as his eyes adjusted to the light. A cold blast of air chilled his cheeks. Upon the shelves, mist swirling, sat a glorious block of cheese. It was pure gold, and the smell... the smell. The boy had never smelled anything more delicious. Before he properly registered it, the cheese rested reverently in his hands. Arms cradling it as if it were a newborn fawn. The cheese was simultaneously cool and vibrantly warm.\n\nClaws sharply clutched his shoulder and the illusion broke. The rumble, beeps, chatter, and lights flooded back to his senses; the cheese ripped from his hands as quickly as his fingers found it. The scold was harsh.The words washed over his body as he watched the cheese blasphemed, merely tossed irreverantly back onto the shelf. Tears stung the boys eyes, not at the verbal barbs from his mother, but for the callous disregard for his perfect cheese.\n\nThe tongue lashing and finger wagging finished quickly, the mother remembering how little time she truly had for this excursion. The boy stood still, shocked and rooted to the spot. His mother turned away with an impatient beckoning of her hand. Head frozen, the boy's eyes slid until his gaze fell upon the cheese once more. The radiant warmth of its embrace welcomed him. His eyes slid to his mother now several feet away and counting. The timing would soon close before she turned and griped at him again.\n\nThe boy's brain didn't process the movement, but he found himself walking dutifully behind his mother, cheese in hand. The boxes and jars no longer called to him, their color dulled and ugly before the brilliant glow of the golden cheese. He gave no cause for his mother to look down. Her mood considerably brightened and the shopping experienced streamlined, the hedge maze of shelves blurring together. Nothing else was real. He had his cheese.\n\nBeep, beep, beep. The hand of the cashier deftly scanned another item from the pile of boxes and bags bumping along the wet conveyor belt. The boy's mother breathed a sigh of relief. The boy clutched the cheese, leaning as if glued to his mother's leg. Money exchanged hands. The bags crinkled in his mother's grip. She stepped away from the register and sighed with a smile. Her eyes took one last look around the area, searching for anything amiss. Her eyes fell on the boy.",

A sharp whistling from afar rushed in and penetrated his ears. The boy's mothering leaned into his circle of light, her face lit from below, holding a peculiar blank expression that he had never seen before. His mother snaked her arm slowly around his middle. The boy froze. The whistling reached an earshattering pitch. Sound, darkness, and his world imploded at same time she constricted his waist.\n\nThe boy lifted high into the air, his cheese ripped from his hands by claws like razorblades. The beep, beep, beep carried on.",
