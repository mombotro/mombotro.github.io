# Welcome to the Drift

*January 15, 2025 - by Alek & Juleah Miller*

Hello and welcome to our creative corner of the internet! We're excited to share this space where we'll document our journey as collaborative creators working on books, comics, games, and art.

## What is The Azirona Drift?

The Azirona Drift represents our commitment to creating together - a "mom/dad pact" to make meaningful creative work while balancing family life. It's named after the beautiful desert landscape that inspires much of our aesthetic and storytelling.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Behind-the-scenes** looks at our creative process

## Our Current Projects

We're currently working on several exciting projects:

- **Round Down** - Alek's strategic card game
- Various other books, games, and art pieces in different stages

## Looking Forward

We're planning to use this blog to share more about our process, inspirations, and the challenges and joys of creating as a team. Whether you're here for the games, the stories, the art, or just curious about our journey, we're glad you're along for the ride.
