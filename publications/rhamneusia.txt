## Chapter 1

Tim Akers was not one to trifle with on the internet.
Born in the late 1990’s, Tim knew nothing but the world wide web. His first experiences were flash games on some innocuous-sounding website that carried all manner of content: mostly juvenile, some of it not at all juvenile. He sought out forums when the games inevitably bored him, and when the forums inevitably banned him, he would seek out the more target-rich environments of social media.
Tim went by Tim O’Leon. When his handle popped up in your notifications, it was a bit of an honor; his infamy earned him minor celebrity. It’s a weird sense of pride, to be in the textual crosshairs of social media’s most dogged harasser, to occupy his time with your - YOUR! - foolish comments. However, it was just a nuisance at first, before morphing into a menace. Tim wouldn’t stop till you blocked him. He would also stop if you completely capitulated your point, but that never happened. You’re always right, of course.
For Tim’s sake, it was a good thing indeed that he could perform his software engineering job’s daily duties on two screens, while trolling random people on a third. His uncle had played solitaire and hearts in the background while waiting on coworkers or code. Tim cyberbullied.
It wasn’t until one Middle Eastern country went to war with another Middle Eastern country for what seemed like the hundredth time that Tim noticed something. Since the US President had changed, so too had the partisan fire-breathers’ opinions. Overnight, previous pacifists became ardent war hawks. And the former war hawks who now called for peace were accused of other egregious things.
Officially, Tim didn’t have an opinion on either country, or war in general. The blatant flipflop intrigued him. He got to coding. Within two days, he had a program that would pull up every instance related to certain search terms, requiring only the terms in question and the username of the person. The program utilized AI machine learning to analyze billions of posts by millions of users. It categorized terms based on synonymous relevance. This was a strict improvement over the advanced search function; that required exact matches of specific words. Tim’s program wasn’t hindered this way.
He called it “Nemesis.” User Tim O’Leon went from annoying to unstoppable.
Verified accounts had their “receipts” dug up from years before. Their opinions had shifted, often more than once. Now everyone could see it neatly and almost immediately. Tim had a hair trigger for certain people’s accounts. Nothing they now said could get past him. Block as they might, Tim had a burner account on his tablet to peek at their follow-up post, screenshot it, consult Nemesis, and produce an exposé worthy of award. All within a couple of minutes.
This was good. Great, even. Tim devoted more and more time to utilizing and refining Nemesis. He took it a step forward. Username “Nemesis-Bot” would - when tagged - scrape the post above the tagger and compare the words in that post with anything contradictory in all of that user’s previous comments. It would then repost the comment with the least closest match, given the subject. If it had been the closest match, Nemesis-Bot would pick only identical opinions and reinforce rather than rebut.
Now that the bot was live, anyone could wield this power. The resulting conflagration from this development made Tim’s original Nemesis program look like mere kindling.
Tim tagged the bot as an example for a half dozen different users. All of them were big-ish names. All of them had a legion of haters following their every post. Tim got in so quick with the bot, it was bound to be found by these haters. Word passed around. The bot saw meteoric growth. Exponential rates of usage forced Tim to invest in necessary hardware just to keep the bot running. He could handle it for now, but he pared back usage to one use per account per day. Some people made sock puppet accounts, but were rarely used. It was sustainable at the moment.


## Chapter 2


Ivan Josefovich Alexandrov usually couldn’t be bothered away from his first-person shooter games. But when his clanmates wouldn’t shut up about this Nemesis-Bot, he had to take a look for himself. Only to keep current with his teammates from the virtual world.
Admittedly, just to himself anyways, Ivan had to chuckle at the memes which resulted from this event. A metric ton of politicians and journalists ended up with egg on their pixelated faces for stuff they said more than a decade ago that directly contradicted what they were saying just ten minutes before now. It confirmed his biases about the world being run on rank hypocrisy, that those in power had no care for consistency, and that their comeuppance was well overdue. This deep-fried schadenfreude pleased him immensely.
“But,” he said to himself, “why should we limit its use to those who use it?” Simply put, it was partisan. Rather, the users who knew about it and used it daily, were partisan. Barely a month of Nemesis-Bot had passed, already it was showing huge favor amongst one side of the political divide. Ivan tended to lean towards this side of the political divide, so he was even more curious.
Ivan (username: stalingradius97) snatched the code off the web. He updated some of the code over the following two weeks. Giving the program a new name, Ivan unleashed it on the site as its own bot.
“Rhamnusia” was to “Nemesis-Bot” what “Nemesis-Bot” was to the original “Nemesis” program. Instead of waiting for another user to prompt the bot, Rhamnusia replied to every user’s first post of the day. Everyone else caught on to this very quickly; users countered it by launching a bogus first comment of the day, something with nothing for the automatic program to work with. Then they could go about their daily posting.
Ivan took the only logical step in his mind. He made Rhamnusia apply to all new posts.
All.
Well, even social media caught the whiff of trouble. Not three minutes after turning on auto-reply, the website and app shut the profile down.
Of course, what’s on the internet, has a way of staying on the internet.
Someone just enterprising enough happened to see the profile right before it was taken down. He had the resourcefulness to upload a copy of the profile to an archive site, code and all. As soon as he hit F5, the profile was gone. Nick of time. The code was on the loose. The signal had gotten out. There was nothing anyone could do to stop what happened afterwards.


## Chapter 3


Five people got ahold of Rhamnusia’s code from the archive and had the wherewithal to implement it into bot accounts of their own. What happened was every single new post instantly received five responses. Funnily enough, each reply revealed a different contradiction. AI comes to different conclusions despite being based on the same data input.
Five grew to fifty. Fifty to a thousand. Even though the social media website shut down the accounts within minutes of activation, the company running it didn’t have the ability to predict which new accounts were Rhamnusia bots. 42 minutes of swatting flies was long enough. New account creation was removed. Nemesis-Bot was swarmed with new hits as harassers migrated over to it. The bot’s hosting company shut down under the pressure. A sternly-worded e-mail from the social media’s corporate executives helped.
Tim Akers was too enthralled by the antics of Rhamusia to be bothered by Nemesis going offline. He was watching all of this in sheer amazement. Giddy with excitement, he initiated the final act. Tim took the Rhamnusia bot code and applied it to his personal account. The account lasted 13 whole minutes before it was shut down, but by then, scores of others had applied the code to their own, personal accounts too. Verified, big-name users joined in. The social media site had no choice but to ban users left, right, and center.
In a final act of desperation, the site closed down entirely for 72 hours.


Rhamnusia’s popularity spread to other social media platforms. Forums got inundated with new users specifically programmed with Rhamnusia’s protocol. Inevitably, each of them shut down in inglorious fashion. The mere threat of Rhamnusia caused many sites to preemptively go dark.
Unintentionally, the result of these shenanigans was peace and quiet on the internet.
Unexpectedly,... people liked it.
No longer feeling beholden to update on fake news and get mad at current event commentators, people drifted to other activities. Many just watched TV or played games instead. Many, however, took up new hobbies. Many more still, reconnected with old friends, or went outside to run errands or get fresh air.
Tim Akers didn’t mind losing his favorite pastime. After a few weeks, the sites that had shut down gradually reopened, though they would never be the same again. And user Tim O’Leon did not feel he needed to return to his old ways.
