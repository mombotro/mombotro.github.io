      "title": "Witnesses: Seven Stories from the Margins of Scripture",
      "author": "Alek Miller",
      "status": "completed",
      "type": "book",
      "description": "Witnesses:\nWhile \"all Scripture is God-breathed,\" room remains for the stories of people not explicitly mentioned or deeply considered. A servant of an Old Testament patriarch; the keeper of beasts in the vast Persian empire; the baker and cupbearer of a great Egyptian Pharoah; a crewman on the ship that encountered a sea creature from the deep; and more. All of these individuals touched verses in the Bible and became part of the larger story.\nIn \"Witnesses,\" these people are explored. Remaining accurate to Scripture, these short stories embellish details in ways that do not contradict Holy Writ. Each small tale is meant to whet the reader's appetite, exciting them to go to the related passage in Scripture, and read the story with its context in whole.\n\nQadash:\nNomads don't carry what they can't use. Naamah doesn't see the prudence in bringing along something that sees no use and serves no apparent purpose. What possible reason could it be set aside for?\n\nAshianeh:\nBruzantes knows what beasts do. He can predict how they'll act, especially when famished. Narrowly escaping death is just another day in the life for the near-feral man. But it is nobles who employ him whom he fears most of all.\n\nNahar:\nWanderlust is a powerful narcotic. No one has a better view for it than Ioannis, from high up in the crow's nest of a trireme ship. Marvelous as his fledging nation of Greece is, it cannot compare to the wondrous sights on the open sea.\n\nLehavah:\nRain. The great life-giver. Take that away, and people die. People will kill to have the rain return. Etakkama's drive to madness is swift and unstoppable when his life is on the line.\n\nMashqeh:\nIntrigue at the royal court is the highest-stakes game ever played. Paser overbid. It's going to take intervention on a divine level to rescue him from his own machinations.\n\nPolus:\nNever mess with beings from the spiritual realm. They have a way of humbling even - perhaps especially - the strongest.\n\nSaoshyant:\nThe astrologers of old were serious and skilled in their arts. They commanded respect and treated their role with utmost importance. The heavens hide many secrets; Zaif helps pull the curtain up on them. He records data, follows patterns, and leaves room for error. He doesn't commit to what he's not fully confident in. So when the stars literally align for him, how will he respond?",
